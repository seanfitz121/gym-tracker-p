# ✅ PWA Cache Issue - FIXED

## 🔴 Original Problem

Users accessing the site from **iOS home screen bookmarks** were stuck on outdated versions after deployments (e.g., old logos persisted even after pushing new ones).

**Root Cause:** iOS and other mobile browsers aggressively cache PWA assets, and the service worker cache name was static (`plateprogress-v3`), so updates weren't forced.

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Versioned Service Worker** (`public/sw.js`)

```javascript
const CACHE_VERSION = 'v4.1' // INCREMENT THIS ON EACH DEPLOY
const BUILD_TIMESTAMP = '2025-01-26T12:00:00Z' // Update this on each build
const CACHE_NAME = `plateprogress-${CACHE_VERSION}-${BUILD_TIMESTAMP}`
```

**Benefits:**
- Different cache name = forces cache refresh
- Old caches automatically deleted on activation
- Unique version per deployment

**Added:**
- Message handler for version checks
- `SKIP_WAITING` support for immediate updates
- Better lifecycle management

### 2. **Aggressive Cache-Busting Headers** (`next.config.ts`)

Updated cache strategies for different asset types:

| Asset Type | Cache Strategy | Reason |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| Service Worker (`/sw.js`) | `max-age=0, no-cache` | Always fetch fresh |
| Manifest (`/manifest.json`) | `max-age=3600, must-revalidate` | Check hourly |
| Images/Logos | `max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate` | 1 day cache with background refresh |
| API Routes | `no-store, no-cache` | Never cache |

**Benefits:**
- Browsers check for updates more frequently
- Static assets refresh in background
- No stale API responses

### 3. **Auto-Update Detection** (`components/pwa/update-prompt.tsx`)

Created a user-friendly update prompt that:
- ✅ Checks for service worker updates every 5 minutes
- ✅ Shows a card prompt when update available
- ✅ Allows "Update Now" or "Later"
- ✅ Auto-reloads after update installed
- ✅ Positioned above mobile navbar

**User Experience:**
1. User opens app (on old version)
2. After ~5 min, sees: "Update Available" prompt
3. Clicks "Update Now"
4. App instantly reloads with new version

### 4. **Manifest Versioning** (`public/manifest.json`)

Added version tracking:
```json
{
  "version": "4.1.0",
  "start_url": "/?v=4.1.0"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- iOS recognizes version changes via query param
- Better tracking in PWA analytics
- Semantic versioning for changes

### 5. **Integrated into App** (`app/layout.tsx`)

Added `<UpdatePrompt />` component to root layout, so it's available app-wide.

## 📋 How to Use (Every Deploy)

### Quick Steps:

1. **Edit `public/sw.js`:**
   ```javascript
   const CACHE_VERSION = 'v4.2' // ← Increment
   const BUILD_TIMESTAMP = '2025-01-27T10:00:00Z' // ← Update
   ```

2. **Edit `public/manifest.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "version": "4.2.0",
     "start_url": "/?v=4.2.0"
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add public/sw.js public/manifest.json
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to v4.2.0"
   git push
   ```

4. **Verify:** Within 5-10 minutes, users should see update prompt.

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ Build Status
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ TypeScript validation passed
✓ No linter errors
✓ Production build successful
```

### ✅ What Was Tested

- [x] Service worker installs with new version
- [x] Old caches are deleted on activation
- [x] Update prompt appears for users on old version
- [x] "Update Now" button reloads with new version
- [x] Static assets (logos) refresh properly
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality

---

## 📱 Expected Behavior

### For New Users:
- Install latest version immediately
- No prompts needed

### For Existing Users:
- Open app → works normally
- After 5 minutes → "Update Available" prompt appears
- Click "Update Now" → instant reload with new version
- Click "Later" → prompt dismisses, will show again next time

### Update Frequency:
- **Auto-check**: Every 5 minutes while app is open
- **On launch**: Service worker checks for updates
- **Browser native**: Varies (Chrome ~24hrs, iOS ~7 days)

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Users still on old version after 24 hours"

**Likely cause:** Version numbers weren't updated

**Fix:**
1. Check `sw.js` - verify `CACHE_VERSION` changed
2. Check `manifest.json` - verify `version` changed
3. Increment version dramatically (v4.1 → v5.0)
4. Tell users to force close app and reopen

### "Update prompt not showing"

**Likely cause:** Auto-check hasn't run yet, or no changes detected

**Fix:**
1. Wait 5+ minutes after opening app
2. Check DevTools > Application > Service Workers
3. Verify new service worker is "waiting"
4. Click "skipWaiting" in DevTools to force it

### "iOS Safari extremely stubborn"

**iOS-specific issues:**
- May cache for up to 7 days despite headers
- Sometimes requires full reinstall

**Nuclear option:**
1. Delete app from home screen
2. Clear Safari cache (Settings > Safari > Clear History)
3. Re-add app to home screen
