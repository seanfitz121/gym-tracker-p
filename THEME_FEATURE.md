# 🎨 Theme Toggle Feature

## What's New

Added a site-wide light/dark mode toggle with three options:
- **Light Mode** ☀️
- **Dark Mode** 🌙
- **System** 💻 (matches device settings)

## How It Works

### User Experience
1. Go to **Settings** page
2. Find the new **"Appearance"** section (right below Profile)
3. Select your preferred theme:
   - **Light** - Always use light mode
   - **Dark** - Always use dark mode
   - **System** - Automatically match your device's theme preference

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Created
- `lib/hooks/use-theme.tsx` - Theme provider and hook

#### Files Modified
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added ThemeProvider wrapper
- `components/settings/settings-form.tsx` - Added theme toggle UI

#### Features
✅ Persists to localStorage (`gym-tracker-theme`)
✅ Works site-wide instantly
✅ No page refresh needed
✅ Respects system preferences when set to "System"
✅ Automatically updates when system theme changes (if set to "System")
✅ Smooth transitions between themes
✅ Dark mode colors already configured in `globals.css`

## Testing

1. **Test Light Mode:**
   - Settings → Appearance → Select "Light"
   - Verify entire app uses light colors

2. **Test Dark Mode:**
   - Settings → Appearance → Select "Dark"
   - Verify entire app uses dark colors

3. **Test System Mode:**
   - Settings → Appearance → Select "System"
   - Change your device/browser theme
   - Verify app theme updates automatically

4. **Test Persistence:**
   - Select a theme
   - Refresh the page
   - Verify theme is still applied

## Design Notes

- Icons in select dropdown (Sun/Moon/Monitor)
- Helpful description text shows current mode
- Follows mobile-first design
- Uses existing shadcn/ui components
- Consistent with rest of settings UI

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- `localStorage`
- `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- CSS custom properties

## Performance

- Zero performance impact
- Theme loads before page render (no flash)
- Uses CSS variables for instant switching
- LocalStorage for fast preference retrieval

Users can now customize the app's appearance to their preference.
