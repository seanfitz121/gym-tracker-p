# Blog Posts SQL Updated ‚úÖ

## What Was Fixed

The SQL script `supabase/sample_blog_posts.sql` was failing because:

**Error:**
```
null value in column "author_id" violates not-null constraint
```

**Root Cause:** Blog posts need an `author_id`, but we weren't providing one.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

The SQL script now:

1. **Automatically finds an author:**
   - First tries to use an admin user
   - Falls back to the first user in `auth.users`
   - Raises an error if no users exist

2. **Uses a temporary table:**
   - Stores the author ID in a temp table
   - Uses it for all blog post inserts
   - Cleans up after itself

3. **Smart fallback:**
   ```sql
   -- Try admin first
   SELECT user_id FROM admin_user LIMIT 1
   
   -- Fall back to any user
   SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1
   ```

## üöÄ How to Use (Updated)

### Run in Supabase SQL Editor

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - URL: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql`

2. **Copy the entire SQL script:**
   - File: `supabase/sample_blog_posts.sql`
   - Select all (Ctrl+A)
   - Copy

3. **Paste and run:**
   - Paste in SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" button
   - Should complete successfully ‚úÖ

4. **Verify:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, author_id, published 
   FROM blog_post 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```
   
   You should see 5 blog posts with your user ID as author!

## üìä What Gets Created

### 5 Blog Posts

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "No users found in database"

**Cause:** No user accounts exist yet

**Solution:**
1. Sign up for an account on your site
2. Verify user exists: `SELECT id, email FROM auth.users;`
3. Run the SQL script again

### "permission denied for table admin_user"

**Cause:** Running from non-admin role

**Solution:** This is fine! The script will fall back to `auth.users` automatically.

### Posts created but no author shown

**Cause:** Author profile might not exist

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT bp.title, u.email as author_email
FROM blog_post bp
LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON bp.author_id = u.id;
```

## ‚úÖ Next Steps After Running SQL

1. **Verify posts created:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blog_post WHERE published = true;
   ```
   Should return: `5`

2. **Test blog list page:**
   - Visit: `https://plateprogress.com/blog`
   - Should show 5 blog posts ‚úÖ

3. **Test individual post:**
   - Get a post ID: `SELECT id FROM blog_post LIMIT 1;`
   - Visit: `https://plateprogress.com/blog/[THAT_ID]`
   - Should show full article with ads ‚úÖ

4. **Check sitemap:**
   - Visit: `https://plateprogress.com/sitemap.xml`
   - Should include all 5 blog post URLs ‚úÖ
