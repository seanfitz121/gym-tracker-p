### Writing Updates
- Be concise and clear
- Group changes by category (Features, Fixes, etc.)
- Use bullet points for easy scanning
- Include relevant details

### Publishing Strategy
- Save as draft while writing
- Review before publishing
- Publish when changes go live
- Keep users informed regularly

## Deployment

```bash
# 1. Push code
git add .
git commit -m "Add patch notes feature"
git push origin main

# 2. Run migration in Supabase
# (Copy SQL from supabase/migrations/add_patch_notes.sql)

# 3. Test
# - Navigate to Patch Notes
# - Create test note as admin
