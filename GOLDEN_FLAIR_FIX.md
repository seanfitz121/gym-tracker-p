# Golden Flair Display Fix

## Issue
Golden flair (premium usernames with gold styling) were not displaying correctly on:
- Compare friends view
- Gym members view
- Gym pending requests view

## Changes Made

### API Updates
Updated the following APIs to include `is_premium` and `premium_flair_enabled` fields:

1. **`app/api/compare/[friend_id]/route.ts`**
   - Added premium fields to profile query
   - Included premium data in user and friend response objects

2. **`app/api/gym/[code]/pending/route.ts`**
   - Added premium fields to profile query
   - Included premium data in pending requests response

3. **`app/api/gym/[code]/members/route.ts`**
   - Added premium fields to profile query
   - Included premium data in gym members response

### Component Updates

1. **`components/social/compare-view.tsx`**
   - Imported `GoldenUsername` component
   - Updated `UserStats` interface to include `is_premium` and `premium_flair_enabled`
   - Replaced all plain text display names with `GoldenUsername` component:
     - User header card
     - Friend header card
     - Stat cards (user and friend names)

2. **`components/social/gym-manager.tsx`**
   - Imported `GoldenUsername` component
   - Updated `PendingRequest` interface to include premium fields
   - Updated `GymMember` interface to include premium fields in profile
   - Replaced plain text display names with `GoldenUsername` component:
     - Pending requests list
     - Members dialog

## Result
Golden flair now displays correctly everywhere premium users' names appear:
- ✅ Compare friends view shows golden names
- ✅ Gym members list shows golden names
- ✅ Gym pending requests show golden names
- ✅ All views respect the `premium_flair_enabled` setting

## Testing
Test these views with:
- Premium users with flair enabled
- Premium users with flair disabled
- Non-premium users

All should display appropriately with the golden styling appearing only for premium users with flair enabled.
