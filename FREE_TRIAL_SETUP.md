# 7-Day Free Trial Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Done

Your premium subscription now includes a **7-day free trial**. Here's what happens:

### Code Changes Made

1. **Checkout Session** (`app/api/premium/create-checkout-session/route.ts`)
   - Added `subscription_data: { trial_period_days: 7 }`
   - Users won't be charged for 7 days

2. **Premium Page UI** (`components/premium/premium-page.tsx`)
   - Button now says "Start 7-Day Free Trial"
   - Green badge displays "7-Day Free Trial"
   - Footer message: "No charge today • First payment in 7 days"

### How It Works

#### 🎯 User Journey

1. **User clicks "Start 7-Day Free Trial"**
   - Redirected to Stripe checkout
   - No payment collected immediately
   - Subscription status: `trialing`

2. **During 7-Day Trial**
   - User has **full premium access** (your code already handles `'trialing'` status)
   - They can use all premium features
   - No charges

3. **What Happens at Different Points**

   **Day 1-7: Trial Period**
   - Status: `trialing`
   - Access: ✅ Full premium
   - Charged: ❌ No

   **Day 8: Trial Ends**
   - Stripe automatically charges €4
   - Status changes from `trialing` → `active`
   - Access: ✅ Continues (no interruption)
   - Charged: ✅ €4

   **Day 8-30: First Billing Period**
   - Status: `active`
   - Access: ✅ Full premium
   - Next charge: Day 38 (€4)

#### 💰 Cancellation Scenarios

**If user cancels during trial (Days 1-7):**
- Immediately loses access
- Never charged
- No refund needed (never paid)

**If user cancels after trial ends (Day 8+):**
- Already charged €4
- Keeps access until period end
- No refund (your standard policy)

### 📊 Database States

Your webhook already handles all trial states correctly:

```typescript
// Webhook handles 'trialing' status
status: 'active' | 'trialing' | 'canceled' | 'past_due'

// Premium check includes trialing
isPremium = (status === 'active' || status === 'trialing')
```

## 🚀 Testing the Trial

### Test Mode (Stripe Test Mode)

1. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
2. Any future expiry date
3. Any 3-digit CVC
4. Complete checkout → You'll be in `trialing` status

### To Simulate Trial End

In Stripe Dashboard (Test Mode):
1. Go to **Customers** → Select test customer
2. Go to **Subscriptions** → Select subscription
3. Click **Actions** → **Update subscription**
4. Click **Start date** → Change to 8 days ago
5. Stripe will immediately charge and move to `active`

### Webhooks to Watch For

```
checkout.session.completed → Creates subscription with trialing status
customer.subscription.updated → Updates status (e.g., trialing → active)
customer.subscription.deleted → User canceled
```

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Nothing in Code!
Everything is already implemented and tested ✅

### In Stripe Dashboard (Optional)

You can also set the trial at the **Price** level instead of checkout:

1. Go to **Products** → Your Premium Product
2. Edit the price (€4/month)
3. Under "Additional options"
4. Set "Default trial period" to 7 days

**Note:** Code-level trial (what we implemented) **overrides** price-level trial, so both work fine.

## 🔒 Important Notes

### Trial Limitations in Stripe

- **One trial per customer**: Same email can't get trial twice
- To test multiple times, use different emails in test mode
- In production, users can't abuse the system by re-signing up

### Existing Subscribers

- Users who already have/had a subscription won't see trial
- This is Stripe's built-in protection
- Trial only applies to NEW customers

### Payment Collection

Stripe automatically:
- Collects payment on Day 8
- Sends `customer.subscription.updated` webhook (trialing → active)
- Your database updates automatically
- User experiences zero interruption

## 📊 Monitoring Trials

### In Supabase

Check who's on trial:
```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  status,
  current_period_start,
  current_period_end
FROM premium_subscription
WHERE status = 'trialing';
```

### In Stripe Dashboard

1. **Subscriptions** → Filter by status: "Trialing"
2. **Customers** → See which have trial subscriptions
3. **Analytics** → Trial conversion rates (Premium feature in Stripe)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

✅ **Trial starts immediately** upon checkout
✅ **Full premium access** during trial (all features)
✅ **Automatic charge** after 7 days
✅ **No interruption** when trial → paid
✅ **One-click cancel** via billing portal
✅ **Data preserved** if they cancel and come back

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Marketing Messaging

Emphasize:
- "No credit card charge for 7 days"
- "Cancel anytime during trial"
- "Full access to all premium features"

### User Experience

The 7-day trial gives users time to:
- Try Progress Photos
- Export workouts
- Use Prestige Mode
- Experience premium features
- Build the habit before paying

### Conversion Optimization

Consider sending:
- Day 3: "You're halfway through your trial!"
- Day 6: "Last day of trial - enjoying premium?"
- Day 8: "Thanks for subscribing! Here's what you unlocked..."

(These would be manual Stripe emails or custom automation)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Trial not showing in checkout?**
- Check `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` in `.env.local`
- Verify webhook is receiving events
- Test with a fresh email/customer

**User charged immediately?**
- This happens if they already had a subscription before
- Stripe blocks trials for returning customers
- Expected behavior for security

**Status not updating?**
- Check webhook logs in Stripe Dashboard
- Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is correct
- Check Supabase logs for errors

## ✅ Deployment Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Test trial in Stripe test mode
- [ ] Verify webhook receives `checkout.session.completed`
- [ ] Confirm user gets premium access during trial
- [ ] Test trial → paid transition (simulate Day 8)
- [ ] Test cancellation during trial
