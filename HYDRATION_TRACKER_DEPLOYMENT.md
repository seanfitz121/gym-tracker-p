# 💧 Hydration Tracker - Deployment Instructions

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

All UI components and API routes have been successfully implemented and the build passes without errors.

## 🗄️ Database Setup Required

Before using the hydration tracker in production, you need to apply the database migration:

### Step 1: Apply the Migration

Go to your Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor and run the migration file:

**File**: `supabase/migrations/add_hydration_tracker.sql`

This will:
- Create the `hydration_log` table
- Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Create SQL functions for streak calculation
- Add performance indexes

### Step 2: Verify Table Creation

After running the migration, verify that the following exists:

1. **Table**: `public.hydration_log`
   - Columns: `id`, `user_id`, `amount_ml`, `logged_at`, `created_at`
   
2. **Functions**:
   - `calculate_hydration_streak(p_user_id uuid, p_goal_ml integer)`
   - `get_daily_hydration_total(p_user_id uuid, p_date date)`

3. **RLS Policies** (should show 4 policies):
   - Enable RLS
   - SELECT (users can view their own logs)
   - INSERT (users can add their own logs)
   - DELETE (users can delete their own logs)

4. **Indexes**:
   - `idx_hydration_user_date` on `(user_id, logged_at)`
   - `idx_hydration_user_id` on `(user_id)`

✅ TypeScript Types (complete and validated)  

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After deploying to production:

- [ ] Apply database migration in Supabase
- [ ] Sign in as premium user
- [ ] Navigate to Hydration Tracker from profile dropdown
- [ ] Click "+250ml" button → verify toast appears
- [ ] Check circular progress updates
- [ ] Add multiple entries → verify chart shows data
- [ ] Check "Today's Log" list displays entries
- [ ] Delete an entry → verify it's removed
- [ ] Meet daily goal → check if streak increments next day
- [ ] Test on mobile device (responsive design)
- [ ] Verify dark mode appearance

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Mobile-first**: Touch-friendly buttons and optimized layout
- **Dark mode**: Full support with appropriate colors
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and pulse effects for streaks
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels and semantic HTML
- **Premium gating**: Non-premium users see upgrade prompt

## 📊 Settings Integration

The hydration goal (default: 3000ml / 3L) is already integrated with the settings store.

Users can adjust their goal in **Settings** → **Hydration Goal** (if settings UI is added in the future).

Current default: **3L per day** (stored in `useSettingsStore`)

## 🚀 You're All Set!

Once the database migration is applied, the Hydration Tracker will be fully functional for all Premium users!
