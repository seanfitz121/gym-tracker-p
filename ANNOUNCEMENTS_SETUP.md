# Admin Announcements Setup Guide

## Overview
The Admin Announcements feature allows admins to post announcements that all users can see. Each announcement displays the admin's nickname, profile picture, timestamp, and message.

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the Migration
Execute the SQL migration in your Supabase project:

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor, run:
# supabase/migrations/add_announcements.sql
```

This will:
- Create the `announcement` table
- Set up RLS policies (admin insert/delete, all users can read)
- Create indexes for performance

### Step 2: Make Yourself Admin (if not already)

```sql
-- Insert your user ID into admin_user table
INSERT INTO public.admin_user (user_id)
VALUES ('your-user-id-here')
ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO NOTHING;
```

To find your user ID:
```sql
-- Get your user ID
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Admin Announcements" not showing in Settings
**Symptom**: Admin section doesn't appear even though user is admin

**Solution**:
1. Verify you're in the admin_user table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.admin_user WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

2. If not there, add yourself:
```sql
INSERT INTO public.admin_user (user_id) VALUES ('your-user-id');
```

### "Forbidden: Admin access required" when posting
**Symptom**: Error 403 when trying to post announcement

**Solution**: Same as above - ensure you're in the `admin_user` table

### Announcements not appearing on Log page
**Symptom**: No announcements card visible

**Solution**:
1. Check if any announcements exist:
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.announcement ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

2. If empty, post your first announcement as admin
3. The card auto-hides when no announcements exist (this is intentional)

### Profile picture not showing
**Symptom**: Default avatar icon instead of profile picture

**Solution**:
1. Ensure avatar was uploaded in Settings ‚Üí Profile
2. Check profile table:
```sql
SELECT id, display_name, avatar_url FROM public.profile WHERE id = 'user-id';
```

3. If `avatar_url` is null, upload a profile picture
