# Username System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive username system for your gym tracking app. Users now have unique usernames separate from their display names, and the friends feature works based on usernames instead of display names.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Database Schema
**Migration Files Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/20241027000000_add_username_to_profile.sql` - Adds username column to profile table
- `supabase/migrations/20241027000001_add_username_to_email_function.sql` - Adds database function to lookup email from username

**Changes:**
- Added `username` column to `profile` table (required, unique, 3-20 characters)
- Created unique index on `username`
- Added check constraint to enforce format: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{3,20}$`
- Existing users get temporary usernames: `user_<first_8_chars_of_id>`
- Created `get_email_by_user_id()` database function for username-based login

### 2. TypeScript Types
**Updated Files:**
- `lib/supabase/database.types.ts` - Added `username: string` to profile table types and `get_email_by_user_id` function

### 3. Authentication
**Updated Files:**
- `components/auth/auth-form.tsx` - Complete overhaul of signup and login
- `app/api/auth/username-to-email/route.ts` - New API endpoint for username-to-email lookup

**Features:**
- **Signup**: Now requires username, validates uniqueness and format before creating account
- **Login**: Supports both email and username (detects if input contains `@`)
- **Validation**: Client-side and server-side username format validation
- **Auto-creation**: Profile is created with username during signup

### 4. User Search & Friends
**Updated Files:**
- `app/api/users/search/route.ts` - Now searches by username instead of display_name
- `components/social/send-friend-request-dialog.tsx` - Shows `@username` in success message

**Features:**
- Friend search now searches by username (exact match or partial)
- Users can find friends by their unique username
- Returns both username and display_name in search results

### 5. Settings
**Updated Files:**
- `components/settings/settings-form.tsx` - Separated username (read-only) from display_name (editable)

**Features:**
- Username shown as disabled field with note "Your unique username cannot be changed"
- Display name can be edited freely
- Clear distinction between username (permanent) and display name (changeable)

### 6. Hooks
**Updated Files:**
- `lib/hooks/use-profile.ts` - Removed auto-profile creation (now handled in signup)

**Changes:**
- Profile creation is now exclusively handled during signup with required username
- Hook no longer attempts to create profile if missing

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Run the Migrations
In your Supabase SQL Editor, run these migrations **in order**:

```sql
-- Migration 1: Add username column
-- File: supabase/migrations/20241027000000_add_username_to_profile.sql

ALTER TABLE profile ADD COLUMN username TEXT;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX profile_username_unique ON profile(username);

UPDATE profile 
SET username = 'user_' || substr(id, 1, 8)
WHERE username IS NULL;

ALTER TABLE profile ALTER COLUMN username SET NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE profile ADD CONSTRAINT username_format 
  CHECK (username ~ '^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{3,20}$');

COMMENT ON COLUMN profile.username IS 'Unique username for the user (3-20 characters, alphanumeric with _ and -)';
```

```sql
-- Migration 2: Add email lookup function
-- File: supabase/migrations/20241027000001_add_username_to_email_function.sql

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_email_by_user_id(user_id UUID)
RETURNS TEXT
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
  user_email TEXT;
BEGIN
  SELECT email INTO user_email
  FROM auth.users
  WHERE id = user_id;
  
  RETURN user_email;
END;
$$;

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_email_by_user_id(UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_email_by_user_id(UUID) TO anon;

COMMENT ON FUNCTION get_email_by_user_id IS 'Returns the email address for a given user ID';
```

### 2. Update TypeScript Types (Optional)
If you regenerate types from Supabase, make sure to update:
```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > lib/supabase/database.types.ts
```

### 3. Deploy Your Code
Deploy the updated codebase to your hosting platform (Vercel, etc.)

### 4. Notify Existing Users
Existing users will have temporary usernames like `user_abc12345`. You may want to:
- Send an email notification about the new username feature
- Add a banner prompting users to customize their username (optional)
- Or leave them with auto-generated usernames (they can't change them anyway)

## User Experience

### New User Flow
1. Sign up with email, username, and password
2. Username is validated for format and uniqueness
3. Profile is automatically created with username
4. Default display_name is set to username

### Existing User Flow
1. Auto-assigned username: `user_<8_char_id>`
2. Can update display_name in settings
3. Username is permanent and shown as read-only

### Finding Friends
1. Go to Social > Add Friend
2. Search by username (e.g., "cool_username")
3. Send friend request to @username

### Login
1. Enter email OR username
2. System auto-detects which one you entered
3. Looks up email if username provided
4. Logs you in

## Username Rules
- **Length**: 3-20 characters
- **Allowed**: Letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscore (_), hyphen (-)
- **Unique**: No two users can have the same username
- **Permanent**: Cannot be changed once set
- **Case-sensitive**: "JohnDoe" and "johndoe" are different

## Display Name vs Username
- **Username**: Unique identifier, used for search/adding friends, permanent
- **Display Name**: Friendly name shown in UI, can be changed anytime, not unique

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run both migrations in Supabase
- [ ] Test new user signup with username
- [ ] Test login with email
- [ ] Test login with username
- [ ] Test username uniqueness validation
- [ ] Test username format validation
- [ ] Test friend search by username
- [ ] Test settings page shows both username and display_name
- [ ] Verify existing users have auto-generated usernames
- [ ] Test display_name updates work

## Rollback Plan
If you need to rollback:

```sql
-- Remove username column
ALTER TABLE profile DROP COLUMN username;

-- Drop function
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_email_by_user_id(UUID);
```

Then revert the code changes.

## Notes
- The build is successful with no TypeScript errors
- All type safety is maintained
- Friends feature now exclusively uses usernames
- Display names can still be customized for friendly appearance
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing users
