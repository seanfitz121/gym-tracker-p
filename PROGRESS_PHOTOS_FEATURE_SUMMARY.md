## üì¶ What Was Built

### 1. Complete Backend Infrastructure

**Database Schema:**
- `progress_photo` table with RLS policies
- `progress_photo_storage` for quota tracking
- Indexes for performance
- Triggers for automatic storage updates

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/progress-photos` - List photos
- `POST /api/progress-photos/upload` - Upload with quota check
- `GET /api/progress-photos/[id]/image` - Signed URLs
- `DELETE /api/progress-photos/[id]` - Delete with cleanup
- `POST /api/progress-photos/[id]/download` - Download originals

**Storage:**
- Private Supabase bucket setup
- Three-variant system (thumb/medium/original)
- Short-lived signed URLs (120s)
- User-isolated file paths

### 2. Rich Client Experience

**Main Components:**
```
Progress Photos Page (Premium Gate)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Upload Modal (with compression preview)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gallery Grid (thumbnail view)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Compare Slider (side-by-side)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Storage Quota Display
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Client-side image compression before upload
- ‚úÖ Real-time file size and compression ratio preview

- ‚úÖ Visual storage quota indicators (green/yellow/red)
- ‚úÖ Empty states and loading states
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications for all actions

### 3. Developer-Friendly Architecture

**Custom React Hook:**
```typescript
const {
  photos,           // Array of user's photos
  storage,          // Usage & quota
  loading,          // Loading state
  error,            // Error messages
  uploadPhoto,      // Upload with auto-compression
  deletePhoto,      // Delete with cleanup
  getImageUrl,      // Get signed URLs
  downloadPhoto,    // Trigger download
  refresh           // Reload data
} = useProgressPhotos();
```

**Image Processing Utilities:**
- Automatic WebP/JPEG conversion
- Browser-based resizing
