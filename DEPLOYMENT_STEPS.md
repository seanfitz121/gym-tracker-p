https://adsense.google.com/

### B. Add Your Site
1. Click "Sites" in left menu
2. Click "Add site"
3. Enter: `plateprogress.com`
4. Click "Submit"

✅ Already in place!

## Step 5: Wait for Approval

### Timeline:
- **Day 1-2:** Google crawls your site
- **Day 2-3:** Content review
- **Day 3-5:** Approval decision
- **Day 5-7:** Ads start showing (if approved)

### What Google Looks For:
✅ **Quality Content** - You have 8,000+ words across 5 blog posts
✅ **Original Content** - All articles are unique
✅ **Easy Navigation** - Clear header, footer, menu
✅ **User Value** - Free calculators + educational content
✅ **Privacy Policy** - Already at `/legal/privacy`
✅ **Mobile-Friendly** - Fully responsive
✅ **Sufficient Pages** - 8+ public pages

You have ALL requirements! ✅

---

## Step 6: Monitor Progress

### Check AdSense Dashboard Daily

**Sites Tab:**
- Status should change from "Getting ready" to "Ready"
- Watch for any policy warnings

**Ads Tab:**
- Once approved, you'll see ad units listed
- Check "Coverage" report for impressions

**Console (F12):**
- Visit your pages
- Check for `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` (means YOUR browser is blocking, not a code issue)
- Look for successful ad loads

---

## Step 7: Post-Approval

Once approved:

### ✅ Verify Ads Showing
Test pages in incognito (no ad blockers):
- Ads should show on landing page
- Ads should show on blog posts
- Ads should show on calculators

### ✅ Check Fill Rate
- AdSense Dashboard → Reports
- Look at "Ad Requests" vs "Ad Impressions"
- 60-90% fill rate is normal for new sites

### ✅ Monitor Revenue
- First week: Likely $0-5 (low traffic)
- First month: Grows as traffic increases
- Optimize based on performance data

---

## Troubleshooting

### ⚠️ "Getting Ready" Status Stuck
**Wait 48 hours** - This is normal processing time

### ⚠️ Ads Not Showing After Approval
1. **Check your account is fully approved** (not just "getting ready")
2. **Wait 24-48 hours** after approval for ad inventory
3. **Test in incognito** to eliminate ad blockers
4. **Check AdSense dashboard** for policy violations

### ⚠️ Low Fill Rate
- **Normal for new sites** - Google needs data
- **Improves over time** as traffic grows
- **Add more content** to help Google match ads

### ⚠️ Policy Violation Warning
- Read the specific violation in AdSense
- Fix immediately to avoid account suspension
- Request review after fixing
